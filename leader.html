			<p class="paragraph">Leadership is a highly valued quality that most seem to fancy themselves to have. They believe that the leader calls the shots, create all the solutions and dictate the future of their teams.

			To me leadership boils down to how you add value to those individuals around you and the teams you work within. A leader is an individual who attempts to improve the situation of those around them through effective communication and fostering innovation!
